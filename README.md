Hello, for now here is a link to my back end.

'https://github.com/averagealloy/cashdash-api'


What is this?

Good Question, This is a simple application where a user can create an account and with that account they can make deposits, withdraws and change the name of there account

How does this work? 

Another good question you are on a roll, this is only one half of the cookie. Above you will find a link to the backend of my project(rails api). But just to see the how some of the components look in the browser you would run 'yarn start' in your terminal.
